# Arcology Network

Arcology is the first systemic solution to address all the common challenges faced by the blockchain technologies today with its sophisticated designs and revolutionary technologies. 

Arcology finally opens door to the long-awaited mass adoption, the future promised by the industry since the inception of blockchain technologies. It is targeting at solving some deeply rooted issues that having plaguing the whole industy for years without effective solution.

## Vision

Arcology isn't just an improved version of any existing platforms, it's system design is fundamentally different from other platforms. Arcology revolutionized the blockchain platform designs. Arcology has been focusing on the following goals:

- [Architectured from the ground-up for a decentralized world](../../arcology-overview/arcology-overview.md)
- Designed with a market mentality that accommodates todayâ€™s real-world applications
- Maintained Maximium compatibility with existing ecosystems
- Built on a backbone of high performance, high throughput and low cost.

## Applications

In Arcology, developers will be able to explore a much broader horizon. Applications that were believed only possible on centralized solutions will be made possible without compromising performance.

- High-frequency decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Resource Intensive Games
- Decentralized social networks


Acology is especially friendly to resource intensive applications.
