We believe that high performance doesn't necessarily mean centralization. Arcology's unmatchable througput doesn't come at cost of sacrificing decentralization. Arcology uses multifactor PoS consensus algorithm to maintain both incomparable performance and high level of decentralization at the same time.

Apart from the possibility that most of the nodes are owned by a small group of people, depriving the average users of the opportunity to have easily to the blockchain application is a form of centralization by itself. With Arcology's unmatchable througput, transaction processing capacity is no longer a scarce resource. Arcology is an afforable blockchain platform for everyone.
