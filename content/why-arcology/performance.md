# Scalability

Scalability issue is the single biggest problem that blockchain networks face today. Over the years there have been proposed solutions to problem. Many new platforms were launched based on these ideas. Unfortunately, their mainnets' TPS have rarely gone beyond a couple thousand per second, which is a big step forward compared to Ethereum, but still far below expectations.

## Deterministic Parallelism

Arcology's determinstic concurrency framework allows transactions to be executed  by multiple VMs without causing concurrency issues or state inconsistency across multiple nodes. Arcology is capable of processing tens of thousands of smart contract calls(not just simple coin transfers) per second.

## Cluster Computation

Arcology has successfully solved the scalability issue. In Arcology, a node isn't just an instance of physical or virtual machine but a groups of machines to share the workload, speedup is only a matter of computational resources you are willing to invest.

## Composability

Unlike many sidechains based solutions(Ethereum L2 for example), Arcology's performance advantage does't come at the cost of composability, which is critically important for many DeFi applications. Arcology is a L1 solution, it does't rely on sidechains to processing transactions, everything happens on the same chain.
