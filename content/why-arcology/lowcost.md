# Low Cost

Permissionless blockchain platforms are publicly available to all users, however it doesn't they are free use. The transaction fee are vitial to maintain a health network envirnment and prevent irresponsible users from abusing the network. On platforms like Ethereum users have to pay high transaction fees, others have slightly different pricing models. Transaction fees play a big part in the blockchain economics. In fact, one of biggest user concerns is the high cost.

On the centralized systems more users usually mean cheaper prices and better services. But In the blockchain world, the economies of scale doesn't seem to apply anymore. A large number of active users on a blockchain with very limited capcaity only leads to congestions and higher transaction fees.
